# Just some scripts I use on my systems that might help others as well
as most of the time they were either created out of boredom or dire need (to not burn out my eyes at night for instance)

## Scripts I use on my Kodi HTPC
* Kodi standalone service for running with Xorg
   * [kodi-htpc/etc/systemd/system/kodi.service](https://github.com/fr4nk3n5731n/misc-scripts/blob/master/kodi-htpc/etc/systemd/system/kodi.service)
* Redshift service to dimm Kodi at night to not burn out your eyes
   * [kodi-htpc/etc/systemd/system/redshift.service](https://github.com/fr4nk3n5731n/misc-scripts/blob/master/kodi-htpc/etc/systemd/system/redshift.service)
* Download script for widevine DRM module for usage with [Netflix](https://github.com/asciidisco/plugin.video.netflix) Add-on by asciidisco on Kodi
   * [kodi-htpc/home/kodi/bin/install-update_widevine.sh](https://github.com/fr4nk3n5731n/misc-scripts/blob/master/kodi-htpc/home/kodi/bin/install-update_widevine.sh)

 **more scripts will be added every now and again**
